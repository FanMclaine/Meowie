The built-in voltage commands framework.

Commands frameworks example:

.. code-block:: python3

    import voltage
    from voltage.ext import commands # Import the commands module from ``voltage.ext``

    client = commands.CommandsClient("-") # Create a CommandsClient (client that has commands (original ik)) with the prefix set to "-".

    @client.listen("ready") # You can still listen to events.
    async def ready():
        print("Gaaah, It's rewind time.")

    @client.command() # Register a command using the ``command`` decorator.
    async def ping(ctx): # Name and description can be passed in the decorator or automatically inferred.
        await ctx.reply("Pong") # Reply to the context's message.

    client.run("TOKEN") # Again, replace with your bot token.
